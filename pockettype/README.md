Both the keyboard matrix scanner and the display drivers are implemented in Espruino. The keyboard can be made to appear as a bluetooth keyboard to a host computer using a version of the Espruino BLE HID keyboard module.

The picture shows a clock application running in the upper display with console output appearing on Terminal on the lower display.
